Token Coin
This is a solidity program in which I am creating a token coin program. This program will take the input from the user and then give the total supply and the remaining balance as the output. The syntax used in this code is simple solidity syntax and uses the basic concept of the solidity program such as if-else condition, function creation, etc.

Description
This is the simple code that uses solidity programming. Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum network, this program is a straightforward contract. The program contains two functions and some variables containing two string types, one of the uint type and the last is the mapping variable. The mapping variable is mapped from the address to the uint type. And about the functions: One is the mint function which incremented the balances and the other one is the burn function which is the opposite of the mint but the burn function also contains the if condition.

Getting Start
To get started with this programming type, you should first open up the solidity compiler that is Remix online IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/. Now, when the IDE opens you first have to create a file in which you can write the code, so first click on the new file which is given at the left-hand sidebar. Name the file of your wish and save the file with an extension .sol. For example, firstcode.sol. Now, write the given code in your file

//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;


contract MyCustomToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "MyCustomToken";
    string public tokenSymbol = "MCT";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        totalSupply += _amount;
        balances[_address] += _amount;
    }

    // burn function
    function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _amount, "Cannot burn more than balance tokens");
        totalSupply -= _amount;
        balances[_address] -= _amount;
    }
}

Explanation


The provided Solidity code presents a basic implementation of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It starts with a special comment, "SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT," indicating that the code is released under the MIT license, permitting unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.

The contract, named "MyCustomToken," includes public variables: "tokenName," "tokenSymbol," and "totalSupply." These define properties of the token: its name ("MyCustomToken"), symbol ("MCT"), and initial total supply set to 0, respectively.

The contract utilizes a mapping, "balances," to associate Ethereum addresses with their corresponding token balances, enabling the tracking of tokens held by different addresses.

Two functions are defined within the contract. The "mintTokens" function allows anyone to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address. The parameters are "_address," representing the recipient's address, and "_amount," indicating the number of tokens to be minted. The function increases the total supply by the specified amount and adds that amount to the balance of the given address.

The "burnTokens" function permits anyone to destroy tokens held by a specific address. The function takes "_address" as the address from which tokens will be burned and "_amount" as the number of tokens to be burned. It ensures that the given address has enough tokens to burn (via a "require" statement) before reducing the total supply by the specified amount and subtracting that amount from the balance of the given address. 

Overall, while this code provides a basic foundation for a custom token, additional features, and security measures are required for a complete and secure ERC-20 token implementation.
